# Newsletter-Signup
This project is created using Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I took the help of MailChimp API to store the data provided by the user. It basically takes the Name and email of the user and subscribes them to the newsletter. I used Heroku App to deploy my project live on the internet.
